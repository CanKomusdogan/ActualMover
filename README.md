## Let's be honest,
### Default OS file managers lack filtering options for moving files the way you want.
Fortunately with ActualMover it makes moving **ONLY the type of files you want** way easier!
ActualMover allows you to set filters like file extensions to specify what kind of files you want to move.
This makes the whole process **easier** and cancels the part where you have to manually choose each file!
ActualMover works both for windows and mac perfectly.. if this repo catches any attention i promise to add support for linux too!
